## Abstract

This paper presents SPI Customizer, an innovative GitHub-based automation system that revolutionizes the design and verification of custom Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) cores. By leveraging GitHub Issues as a user interface and GitHub Actions for continuous integration, the system enables users to request custom SPI configurations through structured issue templates. The automation pipeline automatically generates parameterized Verilog code, executes comprehensive RTL simulations, produces detailed timing diagrams, and delivers professional reports via email.

The system particularly addresses the challenges faced by **analog designers** who lack digital protocol expertise but need robust SPI interfaces for digital-assisted analog circuits. By eliminating the knowledge gap and reducing complex testing requirements, SPI Customizer enables analog engineers to focus on core analog design challenges while ensuring professional-grade digital interface implementation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The design and verification of custom SPI cores represent significant challenges in modern hardware development:

- **Manual RTL Design Complexity**: SPI cores require careful implementation of timing-critical protocols across multiple modes (0-3) with varying data widths and slave configurations
- **Verification Bottleneck**: Comprehensive testing requires extensive testbench development and simulation setup
- **Configuration Management**: Parameter validation and documentation across numerous configuration options
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Traditional hardware design flows lack seamless integration with modern software development practices
- **Analog-Digital Knowledge Gap**: Analog designers lack digital protocol expertise required for mixed-signal system interfaces
- **Mixed-Signal Testing Complexity**: Digital-assisted analog circuits require complex verification spanning both domains

### 1.2 Motivation

The motivation for developing SPI Customizer stems from the need to democratize custom hardware design by:

1. **Reducing Design Time**: From days/weeks to minutes for custom SPI cores
2. **Ensuring Verification Quality**: Automated comprehensive testing eliminates human error
3. **Bridging Knowledge Gaps**: Enabling analog designers to leverage digital protocols without deep expertise
4. **Enabling Collaboration**: GitHub-native workflow integrates with existing development practices
5. **Supporting Education**: Lowering barriers for students and researchers to experiment with hardware design

**Particular attention is given to analog designers** who face unique challenges when implementing digital interfaces in mixed-signal systems. The knowledge gap between analog circuit design and digital protocol implementation creates significant barriers, particularly in digital-assisted analog circuits where precise timing and verification are critical.

### 1.2.1 Open Source Philosophy

We chose to develop SPI Customizer as an **open source project** for several strategic reasons:

1. **Accessibility for Resource-Constrained Environments**: Analog designers often work in academic institutions or small companies with limited budgets for commercial EDA tools
2. **Customization Flexibility**: Open source allows analog designers to modify the tool to support their specific mixed-signal testing requirements
3. **Integration with Existing Workflows**: Researchers can integrate the tool into their custom verification environments
4. **Community-Driven Improvement**: Collective expertise from analog and digital design communities enhances the tool's capabilities
5. **Educational Value**: Students and educators can study and learn from the implementation
6. **No Licensing Barriers**: Eliminates cost and access restrictions that prevent widespread adoption

**The open source nature directly addresses analog designers' needs** by providing a cost-effective, customizable solution that eliminates licensing barriers while ensuring they can adapt the tool to their specific mixed-signal verification challenges.

### 1.3 Innovation and Contribution
