## What Happens Next?
1. ðŸ¤– The automation system will parse your configuration
2. ðŸ”§ Custom Verilog code will be generated for your specifications
3. ðŸ§ª The design will be tested with comprehensive testbenches
4. ðŸ“Š Timing diagrams and performance plots will be created
5. ðŸ“§ Results will be emailed to you with downloadable files
6. âœ… This issue will be updated with the results and then closed

**Expected completion time: 5-10 minutes**
